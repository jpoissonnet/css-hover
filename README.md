# CSS / JS Vanilla effect

This is the code of an effect that I saw on https://randlus.fr when I was looking for inspiration
I asked myself how could it be done with vanilla JS instead of GSAP.

The result isn't as satisfying as the when on randlus.fr (I recommend to check it out) it lacks random images on each
bubble, making mouse movement and mouse speed influence the animations and other things but I'm quite happy with the
results for now.
